      ðŸ‘‹ Greetings Discourse Developer. This html file is used by ember-cli/embroider to define our JS entrypoints,
      but it is never actually used in development or production. Instead, we generate an `assets.json` file which
      is ingested by Rails and used to generate the correct <script> tags.

      When ember-cli is used as a proxy, we use the rails-generated HTML and replace urls in script/link tags
      with the local ember-cli versions.
